# Medical Record Delete - ALL Patient Types Support

## Problem Identified
The delete functionality was only working for Students and Teaching Staff. Other patient types (Non-Teaching Staff, Deans, President, Visitors) were not supported.

## Root Cause
1. **Missing Backend Endpoints**: Delete endpoints didn't exist for Non-Teaching Staff, Deans, and President
2. **Incomplete Frontend Logic**: The confirmDeleteRecord() function only checked for "Visitor" and "Teaching Staff" roles

## Solution Implemented

### âœ… Backend API Endpoints Created (app.py)

Added delete endpoints for ALL patient types:

#### 1. Students
```python
@app.route('/api/delete-medical-record/<int:record_id>', methods=['DELETE'])
```
- Table: `medical_records`

#### 2. Visitors
```python
@app.route('/api/delete-visitor-medical-record/<int:record_id>', methods=['DELETE'])
```
- Table: `visitor_medical_records`

#### 3. Teaching Staff
```python
@app.route('/api/delete-teaching-medical-record/<int:record_id>', methods=['DELETE'])
```
- Table: `teaching_medical_records`

#### 4. Non-Teaching Staff âœ¨ NEW
```python
@app.route('/api/delete-non-teaching-medical-record/<int:record_id>', methods=['DELETE'])
```
- Table: `non_teaching_medical_records`

#### 5. Deans âœ¨ NEW
```python
@app.route('/api/delete-dean-medical-record/<int:record_id>', methods=['DELETE'])
```
- Table: `dean_medical_records`

#### 6. President âœ¨ NEW
```python
@app.route('/api/delete-president-medical-record/<int:record_id>', methods=['DELETE'])
```
- Table: `president_medical_records`

### âœ… Frontend Logic Updated (Staff-Patients.html)

Enhanced `confirmDeleteRecord()` function with complete role mapping:

```javascript
switch(patientRole) {
    case 'Visitor':
        endpoint = `/api/delete-visitor-medical-record/${this.deletingRecord.id}`;
        break;
    case 'Teaching Staff':
        endpoint = `/api/delete-teaching-medical-record/${this.deletingRecord.id}`;
        break;
    case 'Non-Teaching Staff':  // âœ¨ NEW
        endpoint = `/api/delete-non-teaching-medical-record/${this.deletingRecord.id}`;
        break;
    case 'Dean':  // âœ¨ NEW
        endpoint = `/api/delete-dean-medical-record/${this.deletingRecord.id}`;
        break;
    case 'President':  // âœ¨ NEW
        endpoint = `/api/delete-president-medical-record/${this.deletingRecord.id}`;
        break;
    case 'Student':
    default:
        endpoint = `/api/delete-medical-record/${this.deletingRecord.id}`;
        break;
}
```

## Complete Patient Type Coverage

| Patient Type | Delete Endpoint | Database Table | Status |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| **Student** | `/api/delete-medical-record/{id}` | `medical_records` | âœ… Working |
| **Visitor** | `/api/delete-visitor-medical-record/{id}` | `visitor_medical_records` | âœ… Working |
| **Teaching Staff** | `/api/delete-teaching-medical-record/{id}` | `teaching_medical_records` | âœ… Working |
| **Non-Teaching Staff** | `/api/delete-non-teaching-medical-record/{id}` | `non_teaching_medical_records` | âœ… **FIXED** |
| **Dean** | `/api/delete-dean-medical-record/{id}` | `dean_medical_records` | âœ… **FIXED** |
| **President** | `/api/delete-president-medical-record/{id}` | `president_medical_records` | âœ… **FIXED** |
