# 🔄 RESTART FLASK SERVER

## The Issue
The dashboard API endpoint `/api/dashboard/stats` is returning a 500 error. I've fixed the backend code with better error handling.

## What I Fixed
1. ✅ Removed `visit_time` field that was causing issues
2. ✅ Added try-catch blocks for each database query
3. ✅ Better error handling for missing data
4. ✅ Improved logging with emojis for debugging
5. ✅ Proper connection cleanup

## 🚀 RESTART THE SERVER

**You need to restart your Flask server for the changes to take effect!**

### Steps:
1. **Stop the current Flask server** (Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where it's running)
2. **Start it again**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   OR
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

### What to Look For:
After restarting, you should see in the console:
- ✅ `📊 Dashboard stats requested by user: [username]`
- ✅ `✅ Dashboard stats loaded successfully: X activities`

If you see errors, they will now show with:
- ❌ `❌ Dashboard stats error: [error message]`
- Plus a full stack trace to help debug

## After Restarting
1. Refresh the dashboard page in your browser
2. The statistics should load from the database
3. Check the browser console - errors should be gone
4. Numbers should animate from 0 to actual values

## If Still Getting Errors
Check the Flask console output - it will now show exactly which query is failing and why!
