# User ID Login System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully changed the iClinic login system from **Username/Email** authentication to **User ID** authentication using Student Numbers and Staff Numbers.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Changes (login.html)

#### Updated Login Form Label
- **Before**: "Username or Email"
- **After**: "User ID"

#### Added User-Friendly Placeholder
- Placeholder text: "Student Number / Staff Number"
- Helper text: "Enter your Student Number (e.g., 2022-0186) or Staff Number"

#### Updated Icon
- Changed from `user` icon to `credit-card` icon to represent ID cards
- Added credit-card to icon mapping for Feather icons compatibility

### 2. Backend Changes (app.py)

#### Enhanced Login Authentication Logic
The login endpoint now supports multiple authentication methods:

1. **Student Number Authentication**:
   - Checks if the User ID matches a `student_number` in the students table
   - Validates that the student is active (`is_active = TRUE`)
   - Links to the user account via email address
   - Example: `2021-0001`, `2022-0186`

2. **Staff Username/Email Authentication**:
   - Falls back to checking username or email in users table
   - Supports staff, admin, president, and deans roles
   - Maintains backward compatibility with existing staff accounts

#### Authentication Flow
```
User enters User ID (e.g., 2022-0186) + Password
    ‚Üì
1. Check if User ID is a student_number in students table
    ‚Üì (if found)
    Get student's email ‚Üí Find user account by email
    ‚Üì
2. If not found, check if User ID is username/email in users table
    ‚Üì
3. Verify password hash
    ‚Üì
4. Create session and redirect based on role
```

## How to Login

### For Students
- **User ID**: Your Student Number (e.g., `2021-0001`, `2022-0186`)
- **Password**: Your account password
- **Format**: YYYY-NNNN (Year-Number)

### For Staff/Nurses
- **User ID**: Your staff username or email
- **Password**: Your account password
- **Example**: `llyodlapig@gmail.com` or staff username

### For Admin
- **User ID**: `ADMIN`
- **Password**: Your admin password

## Database Requirements

### Students Table
- Must have `student_number` column (VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL)
- Must have `email` column to link to users table
- Must have `is_active` column (BOOLEAN) to check active status

### Users Table
- Contains authentication credentials
- Links to students via email address
- Supports multiple roles: student, staff, admin, president, deans, teaching_staff, non_teaching_staff

## Example Student Numbers
Based on curriculum year:
- `2015-0014` - Mark Perez (2015 curriculum)
- `2021-0001` - Joseph Flynn (2021 curriculum)
- `2022-0054` - Various students (2022 curriculum)
- `2022-0055` - Various students (2022 curriculum)
- `2022-0186` - Example student number

## Benefits

1. **User-Friendly**: Students use their familiar student numbers instead of remembering usernames
2. **Consistent**: Aligns with school ID system
3. **Secure**: Maintains password authentication
4. **Flexible**: Supports both student numbers and staff usernames
5. **Backward Compatible**: Existing staff accounts still work with username/email

## Error Messages
- "Please enter both User ID and password"
- "Invalid User ID or password. Please check your credentials and try again."
- "Database connection error. Please try again."

## Technical Notes

### Debug Logging
The system includes comprehensive debug logging:
- `üîê Login attempt with User ID: {user_id}`
- `üîç Checking if User ID is a student number...`
- `‚úÖ Found student: {name} (Student Number: {number})`
- `‚úÖ Student has user account with role: {role}`
- `üîç Checking if User ID is a staff username/email...`
- `‚úÖ Found staff/admin user: {username}, role: {role}`
- `‚ùå Login failed: Invalid credentials`

### Session Data
After successful login, the following session variables are set:
- `user_id` - Database user ID
- `username` - Username from users table
- `role` - User role (student, staff, admin, etc.)
- `first_name` - User's first name
- `last_name` - User's last name
- `position` - Position (for staff)
- `identifier_id` - President ID or Dean ID (if applicable)

## Testing

### Test with Student Account
1. Go to login page
2. Enter User ID: `2021-0001` (Joseph Flynn's student number)
3. Enter password for Joseph Flynn's account
4. Should redirect to Student Dashboard

### Test with Staff Account
1. Go to login page
2. Enter User ID: `llyodlapig@gmail.com`
3. Enter password: `staff123`
4. Should redirect to Staff Dashboard

## Future Enhancements
