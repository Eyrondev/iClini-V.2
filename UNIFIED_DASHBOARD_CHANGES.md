# Unified Dashboard System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
All users (Students, Teaching Staff, Non-Teaching Staff) now use the **same dashboard interface** in the STUDENT folder. They only differ by their displayed name and role.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. **Login Routing (app.py)**
Updated login redirect logic to send all user types to the student dashboard:

```python
# Redirect based on user role
# Students, Teaching Staff, Non-Teaching Staff → STUDENT dashboard (same UI)
if user[3] in ['student', 'teaching_staff', 'non_teaching_staff']:
    return redirect(url_for('student_dashboard'))
elif user[3] == 'admin':
    return redirect(url_for('admin_dashboard'))
elif user[3] == 'staff':
    return redirect(url_for('staff_dashboard'))
else:
    # Default fallback for any other user type
    return redirect(url_for('student_dashboard'))
```

### 2. **Route Access Control (app.py)**
Updated all student routes to accept multiple user roles:

**Routes Updated:**
- `/student/dashboard`
- `/student/health-records`
- `/student/appointments`
- `/student/consultation-chat`
- `/student/announcements`

**New Access Control:**
```python
# Allow students, teaching staff, and non-teaching staff
if session.get('role') not in ['student', 'teaching_staff', 'non_teaching_staff']:
    flash('Access denied. This page is for students and staff members.', 'error')
    return redirect(url_for('login_page'))
```

**User Info Passed to Templates:**
```python
user_info = {
    'username': session.get('username'),
    'first_name': session.get('first_name'),
    'last_name': session.get('last_name'),
    'role': session.get('role'),
    'position': session.get('position')  # Added position field
}
```

### 3. **Dashboard UI Updates (ST-dashboard.html)**

**Sidebar Profile Section:**
- Shows user initials: `{{ user.first_name[0] }}{{ user.last_name[0] }}`
- Shows full name: `{{ user.first_name }} {{ user.last_name }}`
- Shows role dynamically: `{{ user.role|title }}{% if user.position %} - {{ user.position }}{% endif %}`

**Page Title:**
- Changed from "Student Dashboard" to "My Dashboard" (more inclusive)

**Profile Modal:**
- Shows user's actual name and role
- Displays: "Student", "Teaching Staff", or "Non-Teaching Staff" based on login

---

## User Experience

### For Students:
- Login → Redirected to `/student/dashboard`
- Sidebar shows: "John Doe" + "Student"
- Dashboard title: "My Dashboard"

### For Teaching Staff:
- Login → Redirected to `/student/dashboard`
- Sidebar shows: "Jane Smith" + "Teaching Staff - Professor"
- Dashboard title: "My Dashboard"
- **Same UI as students, different name/role only**

### For Non-Teaching Staff:
- Login → Redirected to `/student/dashboard`
- Sidebar shows: "Bob Johnson" + "Non-Teaching Staff - Librarian"
- Dashboard title: "My Dashboard"
- **Same UI as students, different name/role only**

---

## Database Role Values

The system recognizes these role values in the `users` table:
- `student` → Student
- `teaching_staff` → Teaching Staff
- `non_teaching_staff` → Non-Teaching Staff
- `staff` → Clinic Staff (uses Staff Dashboard)
- `admin` → Administrator (uses Admin Dashboard)

---

## Benefits

1. **Single Codebase**: One dashboard interface for all non-clinic users
2. **Easy Maintenance**: Updates apply to all user types simultaneously
3. **Consistent UX**: All users get the same professional experience
4. **Role Visibility**: Clear indication of user type via displayed role
5. **Flexible**: Position field allows additional role details (e.g., "Professor", "Librarian")
