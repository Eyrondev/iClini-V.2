# REAL-TIME ANNOUNCEMENT SYSTEM WITH AUTOMATIC EXPIRATION

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED

Successfully implemented a comprehensive real-time announcement synchronization system with automatic expiration handling between staff and student interfaces.

---

## 🎯 FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **Automatic Expiration System**
- ✅ Staff must set expiration date when creating announcements

- ✅ API filters out expired announcements in real-time
- ✅ Staff can view archived (expired) announcements

### 2. **Real-Time Synchronization**
- ✅ Student interface auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
- ✅ New announcements appear automatically
- ✅ Deleted announcements disappear automatically
- ✅ Expired announcements removed automatically
- ✅ Silent background refresh (no loading indicators)

### 3. **Staff Interface Features**

- ✅ Expiration time field (optional, defaults to 23:59:59)
- ✅ Visual expiration status indicators
- ✅ Archive modal showing expired announcements
- ✅ Automatic expiration checking every minute

---

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### **Database Schema**
```sql
CREATE TABLE announcements (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    category VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    priority ENUM('low', 'medium', 'high') DEFAULT 'medium',
    author VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    expiration_date DATE,
    expiration_time TIME,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
)
```

### **API Endpoint - Automatic Expiration Filtering**
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/announcements`

**Expiration Logic:**
```sql
WHERE is_active = TRUE 
AND (
    expiration_date IS NULL 
    OR expiration_date >= CURDATE()
    OR (expiration_date = CURDATE() AND (expiration_time IS NULL OR expiration_time >= CURTIME()))
)
```

**Filtering Rules:**
1. ✅ Shows announcements with no expiration date
2. ✅ Shows announcements expiring in the future
3. ✅ Shows announcements expiring today but time hasn't passed yet
4. ❌ Hides announcements with past expiration date
5. ❌ Hides announcements expiring today with past time

## 📱 STUDENT INTERFACE (ST-Announcement.html)

### **Real-Time Polling Implementation**
```javascript
init() {
    // Initial load
    this.loadAnnouncements();
    
    // 🔄 REAL-TIME POLLING: Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
    setInterval(() => {
        console.log('🔄 Auto-refreshing announcements...');
        this.loadAnnouncementsSilently();
    }, 30000); // 30 seconds
}
```

### **Silent Refresh Function**
```javascript
async loadAnnouncementsSilently() {
    // Silent refresh without loading indicators
    try {
        const response = await fetch('/api/announcements');
        if (response.ok) {
            const data = await response.json();
            const previousCount = this.announcements.length;
            
            if (data && data.length >= 0) {
                this.announcements = data;
                this.lastUpdated = new Date();
                
                // Log changes for debugging
                if (data.length > previousCount) {
                    console.log('✨ New announcement detected! Total:', data.length);
                } else if (data.length < previousCount) {
                    console.log('🗑️ Announcement removed or expired! Total:', data.length);
                } else {
                    console.log('✅ Announcements up to date:', data.length);
                }
                
                // Re-initialize feather icons for any new content
                this.$nextTick(() => this.safeFeatherReplace());
            }
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.debug('Silent refresh failed:', error);
        // Don't show errors during silent refresh
    }
}
```

### **User Experience:**
- ✅ No loading spinners during auto-refresh
- ✅ Seamless content updates
- ✅ Console logs for debugging
- ✅ Manual refresh button available

## 🏥 STAFF INTERFACE (Staff-Announcement.html)

### **Expiration Date Management**

#### **Add Announcement Modal**
```html
<!-- Expiration Date Field (Required) -->
<div>
    <label class="block text-xs text-gray-600 mb-2">Date *</label>
    <input type="date" 
           x-model="newAnnouncement.expiration_date"
           :min="new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]"
           class="w-full px-4 py-3 border border-gray-200 rounded-xl" 
           required>
</div>

<!-- Expiration Time Field (Optional) -->
<div>
    <label class="block text-xs text-gray-600 mb-2">Time (Optional)</label>
    <input type="time" 
           x-model="newAnnouncement.expiration_time"
           class="w-full px-4 py-3 border border-gray-200 rounded-xl">
</div>
```

#### **Validation**
```javascript
async createAnnouncement() {
    if (!this.newAnnouncement.title || !this.newAnnouncement.content) {
        alert('Please fill in all required fields');
        return;
    }
    
    if (!this.newAnnouncement.expiration_date) {
        alert('Please set an expiration date for this announcement');
        return;
    }
    
    // Create announcement...
}
```

### **Expiration Status Indicators**
```javascript
getExpirationStatus(announcement) {
    if (!announcement.expiration_date) return null;
    
    const now = new Date();
    const expirationDateTime = new Date(announcement.expiration_date + ' ' + (announcement.expiration_time || '23:59:59'));
    const hoursUntilExpiration = (expirationDateTime - now) / (1000 * 60 * 60);
    
    if (hoursUntilExpiration < 0) return 'expired';
    if (hoursUntilExpiration < 24) return 'expiring-soon';
    return 'active';
}
```

**Visual Indicators:**
- 🔴 **Expired:** Red badge (shouldn't appear in active list)
- 🟠 **Expiring Soon:** Orange badge (< 24 hours)
- 🟢 **Active:** Green badge (> 24 hours)

### **Archive System**
```javascript
async loadArchivedAnnouncements() {
    const response = await fetch('/api/announcements');
    if (response.ok) {
        const allAnnouncements = await response.json();
        // Filter only expired announcements
        this.archivedAnnouncements = allAnnouncements.filter(ann => this.isExpired(ann));
    }
}
```

**Archive Features:**
- ✅ View all expired announcements
- ✅ Permanently delete expired announcements
- ✅ Archive count badge in header
- ✅ Separate archive modal

### **Automatic Expiration Checking**
```javascript
init() {
    // Check for expired announcements every minute
    this.checkExpiredAnnouncements();
    setInterval(() => this.checkExpiredAnnouncements(), 60000);
}

async checkExpiredAnnouncements() {
    // Reload announcements to check for expired ones
    await this.loadAnnouncements();
}
```

## 📝 MAINTENANCE NOTES

### **Adjusting Polling Interval**
To change the auto-refresh interval, modify this line in `ST-Announcement.html`:
```javascript
}, 30000); // Change 30000 to desired milliseconds (e.g., 60000 = 1 minute)
```

### **Adjusting Expiration Check Interval (Staff)**
To change how often staff interface checks for expirations:
```javascript
}, 60000); // Change 60000 to desired milliseconds
```

### **Database Maintenance**
Expired announcements remain in database for archive purposes. To permanently clean up:
```sql
DELETE FROM announcements 
WHERE expiration_date < DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 90 DAY);
```
