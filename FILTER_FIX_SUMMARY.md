# Staff Reports Filter Fix - Summary

## 🔧 Problem Identified

**Issue:** Statistics cards were updating when filters changed, but charts were NOT updating.

**Root Cause:** Charts were not being initialized before the filter update function tried to update them.

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Added Chart Existence Check**
Before updating charts, the system now checks if they exist:
```javascript
if (!this.visitsChart || !this.revenueChart) {
    console.log('⚠️ Charts not initialized yet, initializing now...');
    this.initCharts();
    // Wait for charts to initialize before filtering
    setTimeout(() => {
        this.updateCharts();
    }, 1500);
    return;
}
```

### 2. **Enhanced Debugging Logs**
Added comprehensive console logging to track:
- Chart initialization status
- Filter application
- Data filtering results
- Chart update success/failure

### 3. **Better Error Handling**
- Warns when charts are not initialized
- Skips update if chart doesn't exist
- Logs success messages after updates

## 🐛 Debugging Guide

### If Charts Still Don't Update:

**Check 1: Are charts initialized?**
```javascript
// In console, type:
Alpine.store('reports').visitsChart
Alpine.store('reports').revenueChart
// Should return Chart objects, not null/undefined
```

**Check 2: Is rawData loaded?**
```javascript
// In console, type:
Alpine.store('reports').rawData
// Should show: {patients: [...], visits: [...], consultations: [...], medicines: [...]}
```

**Check 3: Check console for errors**
Look for:
- ⚠️ Charts not initialized yet
- ❌ Error updating charts
- ⚠️ Visits chart not initialized, skipping update

**Check 4: Verify filter is triggering**
When you change dropdown, you should see:
```
🔄 Updating charts with new filters...
```
