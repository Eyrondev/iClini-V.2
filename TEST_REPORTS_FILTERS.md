## How to Test the Filters

### 1. **Test Period Filter**

**Steps:**
1. Open Staff-Reports.html in browser
2. Look at the charts (Visits Chart, Medicine Chart, Patient Demographics, etc.)
3. Change the "Period" dropdown from "This Month" to "This Week"
4. **Expected Result:**
   - Charts should update immediately
   - Console should show: `🔄 Updating charts with new filters...`
   - Statistics cards should update with filtered data
   - Notification should appear: "Filter applied: All Departments - week"

**Test Each Period:**
- ✅ Today - Shows only today's data
- ✅ This Week - Shows current week's data
- ✅ This Month - Shows current month's data (default)
- ✅ This Quarter - Shows current quarter's data
- ✅ This Year - Shows current year's data
- ✅ Custom Range - Shows date picker inputs

### 2. **Test Department Filter**

**Steps:**
1. Change the "Department" dropdown from "All Departments" to "Students"
2. **Expected Result:**
   - Charts update to show only student data
   - Patient Demographics chart shows only students
   - Visits and consultations filtered to student records only
   - Console shows: `🔍 Applying patient type filter: students`

**Test Each Department:**
- ✅ All Departments - Shows all data (default)
- ✅ Students - Shows only student patients
- ✅ Teaching Staff - Shows only teaching staff patients
- ✅ Non-Teaching Staff - Shows only non-teaching staff patients
- ✅ Visitors - Shows only visitor patients
- ✅ BSIT Students - Shows only BSIT course students
- ✅ BSED Students - Shows only BSED course students
- ✅ BSBA Students - Shows only BSBA course students
- ✅ BSHM Students - Shows only BSHM course students

### 3. **Test Combined Filters**

**Steps:**
1. Set Period to "This Week"
2. Set Department to "BSIT Students"
3. **Expected Result:**
   - Charts show only BSIT students' data from this week
   - Statistics cards update accordingly
   - Console shows both filters applied

### 4. **Test Custom Date Range**

**Steps:**
1. Set Period to "Custom Range"
2. Date picker inputs should appear
3. Select start date (e.g., 2025-10-01)
4. Select end date (e.g., 2025-10-15)
5. **Expected Result:**
   - Charts update with data from selected date range
   - Validation prevents invalid ranges (start > end)
   - Validation prevents ranges > 2 years

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Filters not working
**Solution:** 
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `rawData` is loaded (should see: `✅ /api/all-patients: Returning X patients`)
- Ensure charts are initialized before filtering

### Issue: Charts not updating
**Solution:**
- Check if `updateCharts()` is being called (console log should appear)
- Verify chart objects exist (e.g., `this.visitsChart` is not null)
- Check if `chartsInitializing` flag is false

### Issue: No data showing after filter
**Solution:**
- This is normal if no data matches the filter criteria
- Try "All Departments" + "This Month" to see if data exists
- Check database has records for the selected period/department

## Technical Implementation Details

### Filter Flow:
```
User changes dropdown
    ↓
@change="updateCharts()" triggered
    ↓
updateCharts() function called
    ↓
filterDataByPeriod(rawData) → filtered by date
    ↓
filterDataByDepartment(filteredData) → filtered by patient type
    ↓
calculateStatistics(filteredData) → update stats cards
    ↓
updateAllChartsWithFilteredData(filteredData) → update all charts
    ↓
showFilterAppliedFeedback() → show notification
```

### Key Functions:
- `updateCharts()` - Main filter orchestrator
- `filterDataByPeriod()` - Date range filtering
- `filterDataByDepartment()` - Patient type filtering
- `updateAllChartsWithFilteredData()` - Updates all 10 charts
- `generateChartDataFromFiltered()` - Generates chart data from filtered results

## Expected Behavior

✅ **Filters ARE working if:**
- Charts update immediately when dropdowns change
- Console shows filter debug messages
- Statistics cards update with filtered counts
- Notification appears: "Filter applied: [Department] - [Period]"
- Visual feedback shows filtered data

❌ **Filters NOT working if:**
- Charts don't change when dropdowns change
- No console messages appear
- Statistics stay the same regardless of filter
- No notification appears
- Browser console shows JavaScript errors

## Conclusion

The filter system is **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** with:
- ✅ Period filtering (7 options including custom range)
- ✅ Department filtering (9 patient type options)
- ✅ Combined filtering support
- ✅ Real-time chart updates
- ✅ Statistics recalculation
- ✅ Comprehensive debugging logs
- ✅ Error handling and validation
- ✅ Visual feedback notifications

**The filters SHOULD BE WORKING!** If they're not, check the console for errors and verify the database has data for the selected filters.
