# Role-Based Navigation Implementation Guide

## ✅ COMPLETED STEPS:

### 1. **Backend Routes Updated** ✅
All student routes in `app.py` now allow Deans and President access:
- `/student/dashboard` - Allows: student, teaching_staff, non_teaching_staff, deans, president
- `/student/health-records` - Allows: student, teaching_staff, non_teaching_staff, deans, president
- `/student/appointments` - Allows: student, teaching_staff, non_teaching_staff, deans, president
- `/student/consultation-chat` - Allows: student, teaching_staff, non_teaching_staff, deans, president
- `/student/announcements` - Allows: student, teaching_staff, non_teaching_staff, deans, president

### 2. **New Reports Route Created** ✅
Created new route in `app.py`:
```python
@app.route('/deans_president/reports')
def deans_president_reports():
    """Serve the reports page (ONLY for deans and president)"""
    if 'user_id' not in session:
        return redirect(url_for('login_page'))
    
    # ONLY allow deans and president
    if session.get('role') not in ['deans', 'president']:
        flash('Access denied. This page is only for Deans and President.', 'error')
        return redirect(url_for('student_dashboard'))
    
    user_info = {
        'username': session.get('username'),
        'first_name': session.get('first_name'),
        'last_name': session.get('last_name'),
        'role': session.get('role'),
        'position': session.get('position')
    }
    return render_template('pages/deans_president/DEANS_REPORT.html', user=user_info)
```

### 3. **Reports Page Already Exists** ✅
File: `c:\xampp\htdocs\iClini V.2\pages\deans_president\DEANS_REPORT.html`
- Already has professional dashboard
- Already has navigation
- Already has charts and KPI cards

## 🔧 REMAINING STEP:

### **Add Reports Navigation to Student Dashboard**

**File to Update:** `c:\xampp\htdocs\iClini V.2\STUDENT\ST-dashboard.html`

**Location:** After the Announcements navigation link (around line 498)

**Code to Add:**
```html
                <!-- Reports (ONLY for Deans and President) -->
                {% if user.role in ['deans', 'president'] %}
                <a href="{{ url_for('deans_president_reports') }}"
                   class="flex items-center gap-3 px-4 py-3 rounded-lg transition-all group hover:bg-white/10">
                    <div class="flex items-center justify-center" :class="sidebarCollapsed && !sidebarHovered ? 'w-full' : ''">
                        <i data-feather="bar-chart-2" class="w-5 h-5 group-hover:scale-110 transition-transform"></i>
                    </div>
                    <span x-show="!sidebarCollapsed || sidebarHovered" class="font-medium">Reports</span>
                </a>
                {% endif %}
```

**Insert After This Line (line 498):**
```html
                    <span x-show="!sidebarCollapsed || sidebarHovered" class="font-medium">Announcements</span>
                </a>
```

**Before This Line (line 499):**
```html
            </nav>
```

## 📋 HOW IT WORKS:

1. **Students, Teaching Staff, Non-Teaching Staff:**
   - See: Dashboard, Health Records, Appointments, Consultation Chat, Announcements
   - Do NOT see: Reports

2. **Deans and President:**
   - See: Dashboard, Health Records, Appointments, Consultation Chat, Announcements, **Reports**
   - Reports link appears in navigation
   - Clicking Reports takes them to `/deans_president/reports`

## 🎯 BENEFITS:

✅ Single UI template for all users
✅ Role-based navigation (conditional display)
✅ Secure backend validation
✅ Easy to maintain
✅ Scalable for future roles

## 🔒 SECURITY:

- Backend routes validate user roles
- Frontend conditionally displays navigation
- Unauthorized access redirects to dashboard
- Flash messages for access denied

## 📝 MANUAL EDIT REQUIRED:

Please manually add the "Reports" navigation code to `ST-dashboard.html` at line 498 (after Announcements, before `</nav>`).
