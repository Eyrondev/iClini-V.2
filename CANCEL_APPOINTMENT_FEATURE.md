### Technical Implementation

**Frontend Function:**
```javascript
async cancelAppointment(appointmentId) {
    if (!confirm('Are you sure you want to cancel this appointment?')) {
        return;
    }
    
    try {
        const response = await fetch(`/api/appointments/${appointmentId}`, {
            method: 'PUT',
            headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'application/json'
            },
            body: JSON.stringify({ status: 'Cancelled' })
        });
        
        if (response.ok) {
            alert('Appointment cancelled successfully!');
            await this.loadAppointments();
            // Refresh feather icons
            setTimeout(() => {
                if (typeof feather !== 'undefined') {
                    feather.replace();
                }
            }, 100);
        } else {
            const error = await response.json();
            alert('Error: ' + (error.error || 'Failed to cancel appointment'));
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error cancelling appointment:', error);
        alert('Failed to cancel appointment. Please try again.');
    }
}
```

**HTML Button:**
```html
<button x-show="appointment.status === 'Confirmed'" 
        @click="cancelAppointment(appointment.id)"
        class="p-2 text-red-600 hover:bg-red-50 rounded-lg transition-colors"
        title="Cancel Appointment">
    <i data-feather="x-circle" class="w-4 h-4"></i>
