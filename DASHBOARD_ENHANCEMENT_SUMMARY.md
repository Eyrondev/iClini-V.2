## 💻 Technical Implementation

### **Frontend (Staff-Dashboard.html)**

#### Alpine.js Data Properties:
```javascript
loading: true,
error: null,
totalPatients: 0,
appointmentsToday: 0,
pendingRequests: 0,
completedToday: 0,
activeConsultations: 0,
patientsInClinic: 0,
lowStockMedicines: 0,
recentActivities: []
```

#### Key Functions:
- `loadDashboardData()` - Fetches all statistics from API
- `animateValue()` - Animates number counters
- `getActivityIcon()` - Returns appropriate icon for activity type
- `getActivityColor()` - Returns color gradient for activity
- `formatTime()` - Converts timestamps to relative time

### **Backend (app.py)**

#### Database Queries:
```python
# Total Patients
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM visitors
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE role IN (...)

# Appointments
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM appointments WHERE DATE(date) = TODAY

# Recent Activities
SELECT ... FROM medical_records 
LEFT JOIN students/visitors/users
ORDER BY visit_date DESC LIMIT 5
```
