# Weekend Blocking Implementation - Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented automatic weekend blocking for the appointment system. The clinic is now closed on Saturdays and Sundays, preventing any appointment bookings on these days.

## Changes Made

### 1. Time Slot Availability (availableTimeSlots getter)
**Location:** Line ~1228-1244

Added weekend detection and blocking:
```javascript
// Check if selected date is weekend (Saturday=6, Sunday=0)
const selectedDateObj = new Date(this.selectedDate + 'T12:00:00');
const dayOfWeek = selectedDateObj.getDay();
const isWeekend = (dayOfWeek === 0 || dayOfWeek === 6);

// WEEKEND BLOCKING: Block ALL time slots for Saturday and Sunday
if (isWeekend) {
    available = false;
    console.log(`🚫 Weekend block: ${slot.time} on ${this.selectedDate} (Clinic closed on weekends)`);
}
```

### 2. Date Blocking Function (isDateBlocked)
**Location:** Line ~1885-1893

Added weekend check at the beginning:
```javascript
// Check if date is weekend (Saturday or Sunday)
const checkDate = new Date(dateStr + 'T12:00:00');
const dayOfWeek = checkDate.getDay();
if (dayOfWeek === 0 || dayOfWeek === 6) {
    return true; // Block weekends - Clinic closed
}
```

### 3. Blocked Reason Function (getBlockedReason)
**Location:** Line ~1950-1961

Added weekend-specific messages:
```javascript
// Check if weekend first
const checkDate = new Date(dateStr + 'T12:00:00');
const dayOfWeek = checkDate.getDay();
if (dayOfWeek === 0) {
    return 'Sunday - Clinic is closed on weekends';
}
if (dayOfWeek === 6) {
    return 'Saturday - Clinic is closed on weekends';
}
```

## Technical Details

### Day of Week Values:
- **0** = Sunday
- **1** = Monday
- **2** = Tuesday
- **3** = Wednesday
- **4** = Thursday
- **5** = Friday
- **6** = Saturday

### Date Handling:
- Uses `new Date(dateStr + 'T12:00:00')` to avoid timezone issues
- Consistent date parsing across all functions
- Proper handling of date strings in YYYY-MM-DD format

## Clinic Schedule

| Day | Status | Appointments |
|-----|--------|--------------|
| Monday | ✅ Open | Available |
| Tuesday | ✅ Open | Available |
| Wednesday | ✅ Open | Available |
| Thursday | ✅ Open | Available |
| Friday | ✅ Open | Available |
| **Saturday** | ❌ **CLOSED** | **Blocked** |
| **Sunday** | ❌ **CLOSED** | **Blocked** |

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Cases:
1. ✅ Select Saturday date → Should show blocked message
2. ✅ Select Sunday date → Should show blocked message
3. ✅ Select Monday-Friday → Should show available time slots
4. ✅ Try to book on weekend → Should prevent submission
5. ✅ Check calendar visual indicators → Weekends should be marked

### Expected Behavior:
